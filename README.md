# sci-fi.js
A javascript framework for sci-fi (science fiction) style interface design. No really sure about how to construct the framework. But I will take my time and figure it out.

CSSS is used to present several tweaks in one html file.

Call existing themes as functions and manual modifications have higher precedence.-> Templates and flexibility. :smile:

# Inspirations

* jQuery UI
* [awesome-scifi](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi): Sci-Fi novels
* [scifi-underdogs](https://github.com/cubiq/scifi-underdogs): Great Sci-Fi films you might have missed 
* [scifidisplay](https://github.com/chazomaticus/scifidisplay): arduino library for blinky sci-fi style displays
* 

# TODO

* Make highsoft as a sub module. But the code that are used here should be extracted and stored in this repo.
